# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

When Changing:

First run a " git pull origin main " while in the main branch
While in the correct directory "cd biasdetector" run an npm install to get all the dependencies
Create a branch off of main "git branch whateveryourchangesare"
Navigate to that using "git checkout whateveryourchangesare"

Adding Content
Add new files as .jsx
Stage your changes (just the files youve created, NO DEPENDENCIES ex: package-lock.json)
Push branch and create a pull request off of github
